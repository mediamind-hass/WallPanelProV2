## Support

For issues, feature requests, use the [Github issues tracker](https://github.com/mediamind-hass/WallPanelProV2/issues). For examples and to learn how to use each feature, visit [WallPanel Documentation](https://wallpanel.xyz/).

## Features

- Web Based Dashboards and Home Automation Platforms support.
- Set application as Android Home screen (optional)
- Use code to access the settings and make the settings button invisible.
- Camera support for streaming video, motion detection, face detection, and QR Code reading.
- Google Text-to-Speech support to speak notification messages using MQTT or HTTP.
- MQTT or HTTP commands to remotely control device and application (url, brightness, wake, etc.).
- Sensor data reporting for the device (temperature, light, pressure, battery, CPU usage, memory usage).
- System resource monitoring with CPU and memory sensors for device health tracking.
- Remote shell command execution via MQTT/HTTP (opt-in, security warning, runs unprivileged -- see the [Shell Command docs](https://wallpanel.xyz/docs/remote-control/commands#shell-command) for what does and doesn't work).
- Streaming MJPEG server support using the device camera.
- Screensaver feature that can be dismissed with motion or face detection.
- Support for Android 5.0 (API level 21) and greater devices.
- Support for launching external applications using intent URL

## Hardware & Software

**_ If you have need support for older Android 4.0 devices (those below Android 4.4), you want to use the [legacy](https://github.com/thanksmister/wallpanel-android-legacy) version of the application. Alternatively you can download an APK from the release section prior to release v0.8.8-beta.6 _**

## Quick Start

You can load the application to your device from the [release section](https://github.com/mediamind-hass/WallPanelProV2/releases). The application will open to the welcome page with a link to update the settings. Open the settings by clicking the dashboard floating icon. In the settings, set your web page or home automation platform url. Also set the code for accessing the settings, the default is 1234.

## Building the Application

To build the application locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mediamind-hass/WallPanelProV2.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio (Jellyfish / Ladybug or newer recommended, JDK 17).
3. Build using Gradle wrapper:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :WallPanelPro:assembleDevDebug
   ```
   Or select build flavor (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`) from Android Studio **Build Variants**.

## Limitations

Setting WallPanel as the default Home application will always load this application as your home. Removing this feature is difficutl without uninstalling the application. So please do this is you wish to use the application as a "kiosk" type application.

## Contribution

All are welcome to propose a feature request, report or bug, or contribute to the project by updating examples or with a PR for new features. Thanks to all the [contributors](https://github.com/mediamind-hass/WallPanelProV2/graphs/contributors) who have contributed to the project!
